    <h2>
      <p>We focus on fairness<br /></p>
    </h2>
    <p>
      Most people want to be fair to each other, but sometimes they forget, or
      canâ€™t decide on what fair is. If a group needs to share the cost of a
      particular bill, R-STAPS ensures that anyone who pays is reimbursed the
      correct amount and with a minimal number of transactions.
